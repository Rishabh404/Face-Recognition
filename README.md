# Face-Recognition

This project aims to develop a **face recognition pipeline** which could recognize people on the basis of facial features with a high accuracy using Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) feature descriptor. Generally a face recognition pipeline involves the following steps:

**Step 1:** Locate and extract faces from each image

**Step 2:** Identify facial features in each image

**Step 3:** Align faces to match pose template 

**Step 4:** Encode using a trained neural network

**Step 5:** Check Eucledian distance between face encodings

In this project all of the above steps are went through to develop a final classifier.
